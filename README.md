# Java-Raycaster
A simple raycaster in Java I made for a final project. Uses Line2D as boundaries, and also randomly generates mazes using recursive backtracking. This definitely isn't the most efficient way to go about doing this in Java, nor is it a very good way, but I made it myself and I'm pretty proud of it
